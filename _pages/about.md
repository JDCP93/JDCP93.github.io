## Who I am

Hold your breath - academic positions always take a while. 

I'm a postdoctoral research fellow in the [Hydrology and Water Quality group](https://www.oulu.fi/en/research-groups/hydrology-and-water-quality) within the [Water, Energy, and Environmental Engineering research unit](https://www.oulu.fi/en/university/faculties-and-units/faculty-technology/water-energy-and-environmental-engineering) at the University of Oulu. 

I am studying the changing carbon and water cycles of terrestrial ecosystems in the sub-Arctic and Arctic through eddy-covariance data among other observational products.

## Before now

I studied my PhD at the Climate Change Research Centre at UNSW in Sydney, Australia. My thesis was obnoxiously titled "Of Times and Types: Terrestrial Flux Predictability through Memory Effects and Vegetation Classes". It began with two pages of acknowledgements and the following quote:

> For the world is changing: I feel it in the water, I feel it in the earth, and I smell it in the air. 
> J. R. R. Tolkien

When I'm not being pretentious...

## Outside Academia

I hike and bike, mostly. Often just cruising about, but sometimes I get that wanderlust. The highlights being:

* 2016: Springer Mountain to Harper's Ferry on the Appalachian Trail in the USA.
* 2019: Peaks of the Balkans Trail through Albania, Montenegro, and Kosovo.
* *2020: Sydney to Melbourne via Wagga Wagga on the road bike.*
* 2023: Perth - Albany on the Bibbulmun Track in Western Australia.
