I am not a photographer. The last actual camera I owned was a 2MP digital camera when I was about 10 years old. Thankfully, the old phone is nowhere close to being the limiting factor in the following shots - I tend to point and shoot (although I have an unhealthy obsession with long-exposure on the two Pixels I've owned.)

All of these and more feature in my "Desktop" folder that scrolls on my laptop background throughout the day. Of course, they're usually blocked by RStudio, GitKraken, and all the communication apps you can imagine (Outlook, Teams, Slack, etc. etc.).
