The first day of our Peaks of the Balkans hike. Looking back from the halfway point of a scramble up some scree. Turns out, the actual route is behind the ridge to the left of the photo. It only took a few hours to correct via bushbashing across a boulder field, by which time we'd run out of water, the sun had gone down, and Polly's feet were more blister than foot.
