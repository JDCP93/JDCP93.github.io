Mae Ping National Park, early in the morning. The previous night, we'd eaten down on the river at a restaurant on a houseboat. We spoke no Thai, they spoke no English. The first dish was plain (a.k.a not at all spicy) fried rice. Somehow, Will managed to convey that we would like to try what they were eating that evening, no matter how spicy. It was spicy, everyone laughed.
