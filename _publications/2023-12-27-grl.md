excerpt: 'To predict how changes in future climate and weather extremes might impact terrestrial ecosystems, we need to understand the timescales of vegetation response to antecedent climate. Prevailing methods of exploration assume such responses to be stationary, that is constant through time. We present a novel approach that shows how the memory of plants to climate conditions change through time. We show that the carbon and water fluxes of vegetation can be significantly sensitive to antecedent rainfall and importantly that this sensitivity can vary substantially through time. Plant functional type is a key indicator of the role of memory to precipitation, while the response to antecedent rainfall is not determined by site aridity. Predicting future changes in the global carbon sink requires understanding how vegetation responds to climate across timescales. Identifying these timescales at which plants respond to climate is critically important as the climate changes, especially if extremes (e.g., heatwaves) become more frequent due to compounding effects.'
